# Todo List using Go and HTMX

The plan was to create a simple todo list to learn both Go and HTMX, because both
sounded very interesting.

In the process, using Go just for the API quickly got replaced by "use Go for API and web server duties". 😁

Propably the only other thing worthy of mentioning is that besides HTMX, all 'interactivity' (if you want to call it that) on the frontend is plain old vanilla JS.
